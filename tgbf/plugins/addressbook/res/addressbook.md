Save a Lamden wallet address as an alias so that you can reference it faster and easier while sending tokens around.

Instead of an address, you can also provide an alias for the /send command. 

Syntax:  
`/{{handle}} <alias>=<address>`  

Example:  
`/{{handle}} privat=c913e1c146f1426a8c0dc042e92ccc18a54dd612d878c84e433ecc9705d91ee5`
