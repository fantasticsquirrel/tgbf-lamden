Collider  
Enter your TAU (between 15-150) into the Collider as an experiment. You will either “make a discovery” or have a “failed experiment”. Odds of either are 50/50.  

Discovery  
 • submitted TAU returned,  
 • “DOUBLE” your entry by receiving equivalent amount of LHC (based on dynamic check of live TAU:LHC pair)  
 • 10% LHC bonus in week 1  

Failure   
 • TAU sent to Rocketswap, exchanged for LHC  
 • LHC sent to Collider contract for future Discovery rewards  

If the Collider contract balance grows beyond a threshold, surplus LHC may be available to farm for LHC holders.

More experiments using LHC to come.
