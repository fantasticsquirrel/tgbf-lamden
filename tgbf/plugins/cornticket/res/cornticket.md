This is a Lotto-style game. You pay XX TAU and an equivalent amount of CORN and after XX users participated in the game the next round can start. The amount of CORN needed is calculated automatically based on the current price of CORN.  

The winner will get 90% of all TAU and CORN of the current round. The remaining 10% TAU are split into 9% developer-fund that is managed by @Duckfever to support development on Lamden and 1% goes to @Endogen for providing and maintaining the contract and bot. The 10% CORN are sent to GOLD Reserve.
