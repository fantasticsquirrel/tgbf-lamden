Send amount of DEGEN tokens to a smart contract and the contract randomly decides if you win or lose. Chance to win is 45%. If you win, the amount will be returned doubled. If you lose, then you lost the sent amount of DEGEN tokens and the contract will burn 50% of it.  

For every consecutive win, you get 10% extra DEGEN on the amount you bet. So if you win for example twice in a row you get 20% DEGEN on top of the second bet amount.  

**Min amount: 10 DEGEN**  
**Max amount: 100 DEGEN**
