A smart contract determines a random number between 1 and 6 and if you can guess it correctly then the TAU you've bet will be multiplied by 5. If you lose then you lost your TAU.

**Minimum amount {{min}} TAU, maximum amount {{max}} TAU**

`/{{handle}} <amount TAU> <your guess>`

Bet 10 TAU that number 2 will come up
`/{{handle}} 10 2`
