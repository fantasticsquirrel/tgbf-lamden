This is a Lotto-style game. You pay in 10 TAU and an equivalent amount of GOLD and after 20 users participated in the game the contract randomly chooses a winner and the next round will start.  

The winner will get 90% of all TAU and GOLD of the current round. The remaining 10% are split into 9% developer-fund that is managed by @Duckfever to support developments on Lamden and 1% goes to @Endogen for providing and maintaining the contract and bot.  

10 TAU and equivalent amount of GOLD are being sent to the contract automatically. The amount of GOLD is calculated automatically based on the current price of GOLD.
