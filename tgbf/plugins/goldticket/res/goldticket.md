This is a Lotto-style game. You pay XX TAU and an equivalent amount of GOLD and after XX users participated in the game the next round will start. The amount of GOLD needed is calculated automatically based on the current price of GOLD.  

The winner will get 90% of all TAU and GOLD of the current round. The remaining 10% TAU are split into 9% developer-fund that is managed by @Duckfever to support development on Lamden and 1% goes to @Endogen for providing and maintaining the contract and bot. The 10% GOLD are burned.
