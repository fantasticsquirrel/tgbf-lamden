A smart contract determines a random number between 1 and 6 and if you can guess it correctly then the MOB you've bet will be multiplied by 5. If you lose then you lost your MOB.

**Min amount {{min}} MOB**  
**Max amount {{max}} MOB**

Usage:  
`/{{handle}} <amount MOB> <your guess>`

Example:  
Bet 50000 MOB that number 2 will come up  
`/{{handle}} 50000 2`
