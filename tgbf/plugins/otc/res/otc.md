Create or take OTC offers that are processed by a smart contract. Maker and Taker will pay 2% fee on the token they sell. Canceling an offer will result in payback of the whole deposited amount including fee.  

This will trigger a workflow that requires you to provide all needed information to create an offer  
`/{{handle}} create`  

Providing an offer ID will display the offer details. If you are the creator of the offer then you are able ot cancel it and if you didn't create it then you will be able to take it.
`/{{handle}} <offer ID>`
