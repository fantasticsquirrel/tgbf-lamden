Buy a blueberry plant during growing season and tend it until harvest time. Don't let your plant die and take good care of it to grow as many berries as possible!

Once growing season is over you will be able to sell your berries for a proportional amount of the reward pool. Plants cost 500 TAU and 95% of this is added to the reward pool.
